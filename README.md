FTC Robotics OnBot Java operational modes

This repo has a set of OpModes written in java.

These programs are for practice using the Onbot java. 
All the opmodes can also be built and deployed using Android Studio as well.

All these programs are created while teaching my son and/or mentoring the Team 11691 for 2018-19 season.
